I'll answer the 6 questions for this assignment using plots.

1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

They have clearly decreased as we can see in the plot. We can see that the went from more than 7 million in 1999 to less than 3 and a half million in 2008.
