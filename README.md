I'll answer the 6 questions for this assignment using plots.

1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

They have clearly decreased as we can see in the plot. We can see that they went from more than 7 million in 1999 to less than 3 and a half million in 2008.

2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

The total emissions in Baltimore City have drecreased from 1999 to 2008 but this time is not as clear as with the total emissions. They have decreased from more than 3 thousand in 1999 to less than 2 thousand in 2008 but we can see how they have increased from 2002 to 2005 to finally decrease in 2008, the trend is not that clear.
